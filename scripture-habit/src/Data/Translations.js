            backgroundStory: "The inspiration for creating this app came from listening to Clayton Christensen's talk \"Dealing with the Dangers of Success.\" In it, he discussed the close relationship between the Church's 'official programs' and 'personal revelation.'\n\nHe pointed out that programs currently implemented as official Church programs—such as Sunday School, Primary, Family Home Evening, and Seminary—were not originally created by 'instructions from Church headquarters,' but were born from 'personal revelation' by local members addressing problems they faced. Because they were effective, they were later adopted by central leadership and standardized worldwide.\n\nHowever, as organizations grow and everything becomes standardized, it becomes difficult for 'new solutions' to emerge from the field. Brother Christensen told BYU students that he wanted them to 'not just follow standardized programs, but continue to receive inspiration and invent solutions to new problems they face.'\n\nHere are examples of how personal revelation came to individuals:\n\n \n\n1. Sunday School\nTime/Place: 1849, Salt Lake Valley\nImmediately after the pioneers arrived in Salt Lake, adults were desperate to build the foundation of life, and children were left unattended. Brother Ballantyne, a Scottish convert, was pained to see children receiving no education and not learning the gospel. Without being commanded by anyone, he sought permission from President Brigham Young and began teaching neighborhood children in his home (later in a building he built on his property). This was so effective that it spread to other wards and eventually became a churchwide organization.\n\n2. Primary\nTime/Place: 1878, Farmington, Utah\nSister Aurelia Spencer Rogers was worried about neighborhood boys running around the streets late at night causing mischief. She felt a sense of crisis that 'if we don't teach discipline and faith while they are young, before they reach priesthood age (around 12 at the time), we won't raise future Church leaders.' She consulted with the Relief Society president at the time (Eliza R. Snow), obtained approval from President John Taylor, and held an experimental meeting gathering children only in her hometown (Farmington). 224 children attended the first meeting. Seeing this success, it was introduced churchwide.\n\n3. Seminary\nTime/Place: 1912, Salt Lake City (across from Granite High School)\nAt that time, 'public high schools' were starting to spread in Utah, but religious education was prohibited by law there. Local stake presidents were concerned that 'if youth spend all day learning only secular knowledge without God, they might lose their faith.' They proposed to the Church Board of Education to rent a house across from Granite High School and experimentally create a class where students could come during free time to study the scriptures. The first teacher was Thomas J. Yates. If this 'Granite Stake experiment' had failed, the current worldwide Seminary system might not exist.\n\n4. Family Home Evening\nTime/Place: 1909 (started in stakes), 1915 (recommended churchwide)\nIn the early 20th century, society was modernizing and families were beginning to spend less time together. In 1915, President Joseph F. Smith officially recommended 'Family Home Evening' to the entire Church, but in fact, a few years earlier in 1909, a program that had already been experimentally conducted in Granite Stake with great success became the model. The First Presidency saw the success in this stake and judged that 'this is necessary for all the Saints' and adopted it.\n\n\n\nHearing this talk, I learned that 'personal revelation'—in other words, 'actions that were very intrinsic and motivated by love, not instructions from above'—created the current Church programs. I felt that if there are problems in local areas, rather than waiting for Church headquarters to solve them, it's important to rely on personal revelation and receive personal revelation for that area.\n\nHere, I felt one problem common to almost all areas: the scripture study habits of members, new members, and investigators. This is something 'that should be done very personally and within family love' and is also an area that leaders cannot manage.\n\nHowever, I believe that deliberately avoiding addressing this topic has resulted in some major problems:\n\n• Investigators, new members, and part-members cannot easily share their learning with others, succumb to daily busyness and temptations, don't engage in scripture study which should be the core of faith, gradually drift away from God's love, and stop gathering with the Church.\n\n• Even though Church headquarters invests in providing 'Gospel Library' and quality resources, and the First Presidency, Quorum of the Twelve, Seventy, and leaders earnestly seek revelation and share revelations at 'General Conference,' if members don't have the habit of learning, those investments and revelations are wasted.\n\n• What is taught in General Conference and scriptures cannot be mastered by reading once, but often requires individuals to deeply internalize that learning and reach a level where they can practice it naturally. In other words, a 'state where they can receive personal revelation' relying on the 'gift of the Holy Ghost.' Examples include priesthood blessings and ordinances, church, family, and community service, missionary work, and ministering. These cannot be mastered from overnight learning but are cultivated through daily scripture study habits and exercise of faith. Without it, I believe the gathering of Israel cannot function effectively.\n\nThese are just examples I thought of and don't correctly describe all actual problems, but even these show the importance of scripture study habits.\n\nThe Book of Mormon depicts how people's pride leads them to stop keeping commandments, eventually resulting in war, discord, and the collapse of civilization. The prophets of that time addressed these problems through political means, but what was notably depicted was 'the use of God's word.' Alma 31:5 contains very powerful words about this:\n\n'And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just—yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them—therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.'\n\nI believe these words are also very effective in addressing modern international social issues, political issues, and local community problems. This app was created as an extension of school work, but I made it with the belief that it can more effectively address the problems I've mentioned. Through this app, I believe more people can build 'the habit of scripture study' in this rapidly changing and chaotic society, receive 'personal revelation,' and make this society better.\n\nThank you so much for reading this long text. Finally, may the Lord's blessings be richly poured upon each of you."

            backgroundStory: "このアプリを作るきっかけはクレイトン・クリステンセン兄弟の\"Dealing with the Dangers of Success\"というお話を聞いたことです。そこでは現在の教会の「公式プログラム」と「個人の啓示」の密接な関係性について話されてました。\n\n現在教会の公式のプログラムとして導入されてる日曜学校、初等協会、家庭の夕べ、セミナリーといったプログラムはもともと「教会本部の指示」で作られたものではなく、現場の会員が直面した問題を解決するために「個人の啓示」で生まれたものだと指摘されてました。それが効果的だったため、後に中央幹部が採用し、世界標準化されました。\n\nしかし、組織が大きくなり、すべてがマニュアル化されると、今度は現場からの「新しい解決策」が生まれにくくなります。クリステンセン兄弟はBYUの学生たちに、「標準化されたプログラムに従うだけでなく、直面する新しい問題に対して、霊感を受けて解決策を発明し続けてほしい」と述べられてました。\n\nここでは実際に個人にどのように啓示が下ったのかご紹介します。\n\n \n\n1. 日曜学校\n時期/場所: 1849年、ソルトレイク盆地\n開拓者たちがソルトレイクに到着した直後、大人は生活の基盤を作るのに必死で、子供たちは放置されていました。スコットランド出身の改宗者のバランタイン兄弟は、子供たちが教育を受けず、福音も学ばずに荒れていく様子を見て心を痛めました。彼は誰かに命じられたわけではなく、自らブリガム・ヤング大管長に許可を求め、自分の家(後に自分の敷地に建てた建物)に近所の子供たちを集めて教え始めました。これが非常に効果的だったため、他のワードにも広まり、最終的に全教会組織となりました。\n\n2. 初等協会\n時期/場所: 1878年、ユタ州ファーミントン\nオーレリア・スペンサー・ロジャース姉妹は、近所の少年たちが夜遅くまで通りを走り回り、いたずらをしているのを心配していました。「彼らが神権を受ける年齢(当時は12歳前後)になる前に、もっと幼いうちから規律や信仰を教えなければ、将来の教会指導者は育たない」という危機感を抱きました。彼女はこのアイデアを当時の扶助協会会長(エリザ・R・スノー)に相談し、ジョン・テーラー大管長の承認を得て、まずは自分の地元(ファーミントン)だけで試験的に子供たちを集める会合を開きました。最初の会合には224人の子供が集まりました。この成功を見て、教会全体に導入されました。\n\n3. セミナリー\n時期/場所: 1912年、ソルトレイクシティ(グラナイト高校の向かい)\n当時、ユタ州でも「公立高校」が普及し始めましたが、そこでは法律により宗教教育が禁止されていました。地元のステーク会長は、「若者たちが一日中、神のいない世俗的な知識ばかり学ぶことで、信仰を失うのではないか」と懸念しました。彼らは教会教育委員会に提案し、グラナイト高校の向かいにある家を借りて、空き時間に生徒が来て聖文を学べるクラスを実験的に作りました。最初の教師はトーマス・J・イェーツでした。もしこの「グラナイトステークの実験」が失敗していれば、現在の全世界に広がるセミナリー制度はなかったかもしれません。\n\n4. 家庭の夕べ\n時期/場所: 1909年(ステークでの開始)、1915年(全教会への推奨)\n20世紀初頭、社会が近代化し、家族が揃って過ごす時間が減り始めていました。1915年にジョセフ・F・スミス大管長が「家庭の夕べ」を公式に全教会に推奨しましたが、実はその数年前の1909年に、グラナイトステークですでに実験的に行われ、高い成果を上げていたプログラムがモデルになっています。大管長会は、このステークでの成功を見て「これは全聖徒に必要なものだ」と判断し、採用したのです。\n\n\n\nこのお話を聞いて私は「個人の啓示」、言い方を変えるならば「上からの指示からではなく、非常に内発的で、愛を動機とした行動」が現在の教会のプログラムを作ったと知り、もし地元の地域の中で問題があるならば教会本部が解決してくれるのを待つより、個人の啓示に頼り、その地域のために個人の啓示を受けることが重要だと感じました。\n\nここで私は一つ、ほとんどすべての地域に共通する問題を感じてました。それは会員、新会員、求道者の聖典学習の習慣です。これは「非常に個人的かつ家族愛の中で行われるべきもの」であり、指導者が管理できない部分でもあります。\n\nしかし、そのトピックに関して敢えて取り上げることを怠った結果、いくつか大きな問題点が生じることになったと私は考察します。\n\n・求道者、新会員、パートメンバーは他人に自分の学びを気軽に共有できず、日常の忙しさや誘惑に負けてしまい、本来信仰の核となる聖典学習を行わず、神の愛から次第に離れてしまい、教会に集わなくなってしまいます。\n\n・せっかく教会本部が投資をし「福音ライブラリー」や良質なリソースを提供し、なおかつ大管長会、十二使徒定員会、七十人、リーダーが熱心に啓示を求め「総大会」で啓示の内容をお伝えしても、会員がもし学ぶ習慣をもってなければそれらの投資と啓示は無駄になってしまいます。\n\n・総大会、及び聖典で教えられてることは一度読んだことで会得できるものではなく、個人がその学びを内面に深く落とし込み、自然と実践できるようになるまでのレベルを要求されることがしばしばあります。いわば「聖霊の賜物」を頼り「個人の啓示を受けられる状態」です。神権による祝福と儀式、教会、家族、地域における奉仕、伝道活動やミニスタリングがその例になると思います。これらは一朝一夕の学習から会得できるものではなく、日常の聖典学習の習慣、信仰の行使によって修練されるものであります。それなしにはイスラエルの集合は効果的に機能しないと私は思います。\n\nこれらは私が考えた一例であり、実際の全て問題を正しく描写したものではありませんが、これだけでも聖典学習の習慣の重要性が伺えると思います。\n\nモルモン書の中には民の高慢により戒めを守らなくなり、やがて戦争、不和が生じ文明が失墜していく様子が描かれてます。当時の預言者達はもちろん政治的な方法でそれらの問題を対処してましたが、特筆して描かれてたのは「神の言葉の利用」です。アルマ31章5節にはそれについての非常に力強い言葉が書かれてます。\n\n「御言葉を説き教えることは民に正しいことを行わせるのに大きな効果があり、まことにそれは、剣やそのほか、これまで民に起こったどのようなことよりも民の心に力強い影響を及ぼしたので、アルマはこの度も神の言葉の力を使うのが望ましいと思った。」\n\nこの言葉は現代の国際的な社会問題、政治問題また地元地域における問題の対処にも非常に有効であると私は信じてます。このアプリは学校の課題の延長で作ったものですが、私がこれまでに上げた問題をより効果的に対処できるという信念をもって作りました。このアプリを通して一人でも多くの方々がこの目まぐるしく変化し、混沌とした社会の中で「聖典学習をする習慣」を築き、「個人の啓示」を受けてこの社会をより良いものにできると信じてます。\n\nここまで長い文章を読んでくださり、本当にありがとうございます。最後になりますが、皆さん一人ひとりの元に主の恵みが豊かに注がれますように。"

            backgroundStory: "A inspiração para criar este aplicativo veio de ouvir a palestra de Clayton Christensen \"Dealing with the Dangers of Success.\" Nela, ele discutiu a relação próxima entre os 'programas oficiais' da Igreja e a 'revelação pessoal.'\n\nEle apontou que programas atualmente implementados como programas oficiais da Igreja—como Escola Dominical, Primária, Noite Familiar e Seminário—não foram originalmente criados por 'instruções da sede da Igreja,' mas nasceram da 'revelação pessoal' de membros locais enfrentando problemas que encontraram. Porque foram eficazes, foram posteriormente adotados pela liderança central e padronizados mundialmente.\n\nNo entanto, à medida que as organizações crescem e tudo se torna padronizado, torna-se difícil para 'novas soluções' emergirem do campo. Irmão Christensen disse aos alunos da BYU que ele queria que eles 'não apenas seguissem programas padronizados, mas continuassem a receber inspiração e inventar soluções para novos problemas que enfrentam.'\n\nAqui estão exemplos de como a revelação pessoal veio aos indivíduos:\n\n \n\n1. Escola Dominical\nTempo/Lugar: 1849, Vale do Lago Salgado\nImediatamente após os pioneiros chegarem ao Lago Salgado, os adultos estavam desesperados para construir a fundação da vida, e as crianças foram deixadas sem supervisão. Irmão Ballantyne, um convertido escocês, sentiu dor ao ver crianças não recebendo educação e não aprendendo o evangelho. Sem ser comandado por ninguém, ele pediu permissão ao Presidente Brigham Young e começou a ensinar crianças da vizinhança em sua casa (depois em um prédio que construiu em sua propriedade). Isso foi tão eficaz que se espalhou para outras alas e eventualmente se tornou uma organização de toda a Igreja.\n\n2. Primária\nTempo/Lugar: 1878, Farmington, Utah\nIrmã Aurelia Spencer Rogers estava preocupada com meninos da vizinhança correndo pelas ruas tarde da noite causando problemas. Ela sentiu um senso de crise de que 'se não ensinarmos disciplina e fé enquanto são jovens, antes de atingirem a idade do sacerdócio (cerca de 12 na época), não criaremos futuros líderes da Igreja.' Ela consultou a presidente da Sociedade de Socorro na época (Eliza R. Snow), obteve aprovação do Presidente John Taylor, e realizou uma reunião experimental reunindo crianças apenas em sua cidade natal (Farmington). 224 crianças participaram da primeira reunião. Vendo este sucesso, foi introduzido em toda a Igreja.\n\n3. Seminário\nTempo/Lugar: 1912, Salt Lake City (em frente à Granite High School)\nNaquela época, 'escolas públicas' estavam começando a se espalhar em Utah, mas a educação religiosa era proibida por lei lá. Presidentes de estaca locais estavam preocupados que 'se os jovens passarem o dia todo aprendendo apenas conhecimento secular sem Deus, eles podem perder sua fé.' Eles propuseram ao Conselho de Educação da Igreja alugar uma casa em frente à Granite High School e criar experimentalmente uma classe onde os alunos pudessem vir durante o tempo livre para estudar as escrituras. O primeiro professor foi Thomas J. Yates. Se este 'experimento da Estaca Granite' tivesse falha do, o sistema de Seminário mundial atual pode não existir.\n\n4. Noite Familiar\nTempo/Lugar: 1909 (iniciado em estacas), 1915 (recomendado para toda a Igreja)\nNo início do século 20, a sociedade estava se modernizando e as famílias estavam começando a passar menos tempo juntas. Em 1915, o Presidente Joseph F. Smith recomendou oficialmente a 'Noite Familiar' para toda a Igreja, mas na verdade, alguns anos antes em 1909, um programa que já havia sido conduzido experimentalmente na Estaca Granite com grande sucesso se tornou o modelo. A Primeira Presidência viu o sucesso nesta estaca e julgou que 'isso é necessário para todos os Santos' e o adotou.\n\n\n\nAo ouvir esta palestra, aprendi que 'revelação pessoal'—em outras palavras, 'ações que eram muito intrínsecas e motivadas pelo amor, não instruções de cima'—criou os programas atuais da Igreja. Senti que se há problemas em áreas locais, ao invés de esperar que a sede da Igreja os resolva, é importante confiar na revelação pessoal e receber revelação pessoal para aquela área.\n\nAqui, senti um problema comum a quase todas as áreas: os hábitos de estudo das escrituras de membros, novos membros e investigadores. Isso é algo 'que deve ser feito muito pessoalmente e dentro do amor familiar' e também é uma área que os líderes não podem gerenciar.\n\nNo entanto, acredito que evitar deliberadamente abordar este tópico resultou em alguns problemas importantes:\n\n• Investigadores, novos membros e membros parciais não podem facilmente compartilhar seu aprendizado com outros, sucumbem à agitação diária e tentações, não se envolvem no estudo das escrituras que deveria ser o núcleo da fé, gradualmente se afastam do amor de Deus, e param de se reunir com a Igreja.\n\n• Mesmo que a sede da Igreja invista em fornecer 'Biblioteca do Evangelho' e recursos de qualidade, e a Primeira Presidência, Quórum dos Doze, Setenta e líderes busquem fervorosamente revelação e compartilhem revelações na 'Conferência Geral,' se os membros não têm o hábito de aprender, esses investimentos e revelações são desperdiçados.\n\n• O que é ensinado na Conferência Geral e nas escrituras não pode ser dominado lendo uma vez, mas muitas vezes requer que os indivíduos internalizem profundamente esse aprendizado e atinjam um nível onde possam praticá-lo naturalmente. Em outras palavras, um 'estado onde podem receber revelação pessoal' confiando no 'dom do Espírito Santo.' Exemplos incluem bênçãos e ordenanças do sacerdócio, serviço na igreja, família e comunidade, trabalho missionário e ministério. Estes não podem ser dominados com aprendizado noturno, mas são cultivados através de hábitos diários de estudo das escrituras e exercício de fé. Sem isso, acredito que a reunião de Israel não pode funcionar efetivamente.\n\nEstes são apenas exemplos que pensei e não descrevem corretamente todos os problemas reais, mas mesmo estes mostram a importância dos hábitos de estudo das escrituras.\n\nO Livro de Mórmon retrata como o orgulho das pessoas as leva a parar de guardar os mandamentos, eventualmente resultando em guerra, discórdia e o colapso da civilização. Os profetas daquele tempo abordaram esses problemas através de meios políticos, mas o que foi notavelmente retratado foi 'o uso da palavra de Deus.' Alma 31:5 contém palavras muito poderosas sobre isso:\n\n'E agora, como a pregação da palavra tinha uma grande tendência a levar as pessoas a fazer o que era justo—sim, tinha tido um efeito mais poderoso sobre as mentes das pessoas do que a espada, ou qualquer outra coisa que lhes tivesse acontecido—portanto Alma pensou que era conveniente que tentassem a virtude da palavra de Deus.'\n\nAcredito que estas palavras também são muito eficazes para abordar questões sociais internacionais modernas, questões políticas e problemas da comunidade local. Este aplicativo foi criado como uma extensão do trabalho escolar, mas o fiz com a crença de que pode abordar mais efetivamente os problemas que mencionei. Através deste aplicativo, acredito que mais pessoas podem construir 'o hábito de estudo das escrituras' nesta sociedade em rápida mudança e caótica, receber 'revelação pessoal' e tornar esta sociedade melhor.\n\nMuito obrigado por ler este longo texto. Finalmente, que as bênçãos do Senhor sejam ricamente derramadas sobre cada um de vocês."

            backgroundStory: "創建此應用程式的靈感來自聆聽克雷頓·克里斯滕森的演講「應對成功的危險」。在演講中,他討論了教會「官方計劃」與「個人啟示」之間的密切關係。\n\n他指出,目前作為教會官方計劃實施的計劃——如主日學、初級會、家庭晚會和福音進修班——最初並非由「教會總部的指示」創建,而是由當地成員通過「個人啟示」解決他們面臨的問題而誕生的。因為它們有效,後來被中央領導層採納並在全球標準化。\n\n然而,隨著組織的發展和一切變得標準化,「新解決方案」很難從現場出現。克里斯滕森弟兄告訴楊百翰大學的學生,他希望他們「不僅遵循標準化的計劃,而且繼續接受靈感並為他們面臨的新問題發明解決方案。」\n\n以下是個人啟示如何降臨於個人的例子:\n\n \n\n1. 主日學\n時間/地點: 1849年,鹽湖谷\n先驅者抵達鹽湖後不久,成年人拼命建立生活基礎,孩子們則無人照管。蘇格蘭歸信者鮑倫坦弟兄看到孩子們沒有接受教育也沒有學習福音而感到痛心。未經任何人命令,他向楊百翰會長尋求許可,開始在自己家中(後來在他在自己土地上建造的建築中)教導鄰居的孩子們。這非常有效,傳播到其他支會,最終成為全教會組織。\n\n2. 初級會\n時間/地點: 1878年,猶他州法明頓\n奧雷利亞·斯賓塞·羅傑斯姐妹擔心鄰居男孩深夜在街上亂跑惹麻煩。她感到一種危機感,「如果我們不在他們年輕時,在達到聖職年齡(當時約12歲)之前教導紀律和信仰,我們就無法培養未來的教會領袖。」她向當時的慈助會會長(伊麗莎·R·斯諾)諮詢,獲得約翰·泰勒會長的批准,僅在她的家鄉(法明頓)舉行了一次實驗性會議,聚集孩子們。第一次會議有224名兒童參加。看到這一成功,它被引入全教會。\n\n3. 福音進修班\n時間/地點: 1912年,鹽湖城(花崗岩高中對面)\n當時,「公立高中」開始在猶他州傳播,但那裡的法律禁止宗教教育。當地支聯會會長擔心「如果年輕人整天只學習沒有神的世俗知識,他們可能會失去信仰。」他們向教會教育委員會提議在花崗岩高中對面租一所房子,實驗性地創建一個課程,學生可以在空閒時間來學習經文。第一位教師是托馬斯·J·耶茨。如果這個「花崗岩支聯會實驗」失敗了,目前的全球福音進修班系統可能不存在。\n\n4. 家庭晚會\n時間/地點: 1909年(在支聯會開始),1915年(向全教會推薦)\n在20世紀初,社會正在現代化,家庭開始減少在一起的時間。1915年,約瑟·F·斯密會長正式向全教會推薦「家庭晚會」,但實際上,幾年前的1909年,在花崗岩支聯會已經實驗性地進行並取得巨大成功的計劃成為了模型。總會會長團看到這個支聯會的成功,判斷「這對所有聖徒都是必要的」並採納了它。\n\n\n\n聽到這次演講,我了解到「個人啟示」——換句話說,「非常內在並由愛驅動的行動,而不是來自上面的指示」——創造了當前的教會計劃。我感到,如果當地地區存在問題,與其等待教會總部解決,不如依靠個人啟示並為該地區接受個人啟示更為重要。\n\n在這裡,我感到一個幾乎所有地區都普遍存在的問題:成員、新成員和慕道友的經文學習習慣。這是「應該非常個人化地並在家庭愛中進行的事情」,也是領袖無法管理的領域。\n\n然而,我認為刻意避免解決這個話題導致了一些重大問題:\n\n• 慕道友、新成員和部分成員不能輕易地與他人分享他們的學習,屈服於日常忙碌和誘惑,不參與應該是信仰核心的經文學習,逐漸遠離神的愛,並停止與教會聚集。\n\n• 即使教會總部投資提供「福音圖書館」和優質資源,總會會長團、十二使徒定額組、七十員和領袖們熱切尋求啟示並在「總會大會」上分享啟示,如果成員沒有學習的習慣,這些投資和啟示就被浪費了。\n\n• 在總會大會和經文中教導的內容不能通過閱讀一次就掌握,而是往往需要個人深入內化該學習並達到可以自然實踐的水平。換句話說,依靠「聖靈的恩賜」的「可以接受個人啟示的狀態」。例子包括聖職祝福和教儀、教會、家庭和社區服務、傳教工作和施助。這些不能通過一夜的學習來掌握,而是通過日常經文學習習慣和信心的運用來培養的。沒有它,我相信以色列的聚集無法有效運作。\n\n這些只是我想到的例子,並沒有正確描述所有實際問題,但即使這些也顯示了經文學習習慣的重要性。\n\n摩爾門經描繪了人們的驕傲如何導致他們停止遵守誡命,最終導致戰爭、不和以及文明的崩潰。那個時代的先知通過政治手段解決了這些問題,但值得注意的是「使用神的話語」。阿爾瑪書31:5包含了關於此的非常有力的話語:\n\n「現在,因為宣講神的話大有成效,能引導人民去做正義的事——是的,它對人民的思想所產生的影響,比刀劍或任何曾經發生在他們身上的事都更有力——因此阿爾瑪認為他們應該試試神話語的力量。」\n\n我相信這些話語在解決現代國際社會問題、政治問題和當地社區問題方面也非常有效。這個應用程式是作為學校作業的延伸而創建的,但我以相信它可以更有效地解決我提到的問題的信念製作了它。通過這個應用程式,我相信更多人可以在這個快速變化和混亂的社會中建立「經文學習的習慣」,接受「個人啟示」,並使這個社會變得更好。\n\n非常感謝您閱讀這篇長文。最後,願主的祝福豐富地傾注在你們每個人身上。"

            appBackground: "Antecedentes del Desarrollo de la Aplicación",
            backgroundStory: "La inspiración para crear esta aplicación vino de escuchar la charla de Clayton Christensen \"Dealing with the Dangers of Success\". En ella, discutió la estrecha relación entre los 'programas oficiales' de la Iglesia y la 'revelación personal'.\n\nSeñaló que los programas actualmente implementados como programas oficiales de la Iglesia—como la Escuela Dominical, la Primaria, la Noche de Hogar y el Seminario—no fueron originalmente creados por 'instrucciones de la sede de la Iglesia', sino que nacieron de la 'revelación personal' de miembros locales que enfrentaban problemas. Debido a que fueron efectivos, fueron posteriormente adoptados por el liderazgo central y estandarizados a nivel mundial.\n\nSin embargo, a medida que las organizaciones crecen y todo se estandariza, se vuelve difícil que surjan 'nuevas soluciones' del campo. El hermano Christensen dijo a los estudiantes de BYU que quería que 'no solo siguieran programas estandarizados, sino que continuaran recibiendo inspiración e inventando soluciones a los nuevos problemas que enfrentan'.\n\nAquí hay ejemplos de cómo la revelación personal llegó a los individuos:\n\n \n\n1. Escuela Dominical\nTiempo/Lugar: 1849, Valle del Lago Salado\nInmediatamente después de que los pioneros llegaran al Lago Salado, los adultos estaban desesperados por construir los cimientos de la vida, y los niños quedaron desatendidos. El hermano Ballantyne, un converso escocés, sintió dolor al ver a los niños sin recibir educación ni aprender el evangelio. Sin que nadie se lo ordenara, buscó permiso del presidente Brigham Young y comenzó a enseñar a los niños del vecindario en su casa (más tarde en un edificio que construyó en su propiedad). Esto fue tan efectivo que se extendió a otros barrios y finalmente se convirtió en una organización de toda la Iglesia.\n\n2. Primaria\nTiempo/Lugar: 1878, Farmington, Utah\nLa hermana Aurelia Spencer Rogers estaba preocupada por los niños del vecindario que corrían por las calles tarde en la noche causando problemas. Sintió un sentido de crisis de que 'si no enseñamos disciplina y fe mientras son jóvenes, antes de que lleguen a la edad del sacerdocio (alrededor de 12 en ese momento), no criaremos futuros líderes de la Iglesia'. Consultó con la presidenta de la Sociedad de Socorro de ese momento (Eliza R. Snow), obtuvo la aprobación del presidente John Taylor, y realizó una reunión experimental reuniendo niños solo en su ciudad natal (Farmington). 224 niños asistieron a la primera reunión. Al ver este éxito, se introdujo en toda la Iglesia.\n\n3. Seminario\nTiempo/Lugar: 1912, Salt Lake City (frente a la Escuela Secundaria Granite)\nEn ese momento, las 'escuelas secundarias públicas' comenzaban a extenderse en Utah, pero la educación religiosa estaba prohibida por ley allí. Los presidentes de estaca locales estaban preocupados de que 'si los jóvenes pasan todo el día aprendiendo solo conocimiento secular sin Dios, podrían perder su fe'. Propusieron a la Junta de Educación de la Iglesia alquilar una casa frente a la Escuela Secundaria Granite y crear experimentalmente una clase donde los estudiantes pudieran venir durante el tiempo libre para estudiar las escrituras. El primer maestro fue Thomas J. Yates. Si este 'experimento de la Estaca Granite' hubiera fallado, el actual sistema de Seminario mundial podría no existir.\n\n4. Noche de Hogar\nTiempo/Lugar: 1909 (comenzó en estacas), 1915 (recomendado para toda la Iglesia)\nA principios del siglo XX, la sociedad se estaba modernizando y las familias comenzaban a pasar menos tiempo juntas. En 1915, el presidente Joseph F. Smith recomendó oficialmente la 'Noche de Hogar' a toda la Iglesia, pero de hecho, unos años antes en 1909, un programa que ya se había realizado experimentalmente en la Estaca Granite con gran éxito se convirtió en el modelo. La Primera Presidencia vio el éxito en esta estaca y juzgó que 'esto es necesario para todos los Santos' y lo adoptó.\n\n\n\nAl escuchar esta charla, aprendí que la 'revelación personal'—en otras palabras, 'acciones que eran muy intrínsecas y motivadas por el amor, no instrucciones de arriba'—creó los programas actuales de la Iglesia. Sentí que si hay problemas en áreas locales, en lugar de esperar a que la sede de la Iglesia los resuelva, es importante confiar en la revelación personal y recibir revelación personal para esa área.\n\nAquí, sentí un problema común a casi todas las áreas: los hábitos de estudio de las Escrituras de miembros, nuevos miembros e investigadores. Esto es algo 'que debe hacerse de manera muy personal y dentro del amor familiar' y también es un área que los líderes no pueden administrar.\n\nSin embargo, creo que evitar deliberadamente abordar este tema ha resultado en algunos problemas importantes:\n\n• Los investigadores, nuevos miembros y miembros parciales no pueden compartir fácilmente su aprendizaje con otros, sucumben al ajetreo diario y tentaciones, no participan en el estudio de las Escrituras que debería ser el núcleo de la fe, se alejan gradualmente del amor de Dios y dejan de reunirse con la Iglesia.\n\n• Aunque la sede de la Iglesia invierte en proporcionar la 'Biblioteca del Evangelio' y recursos de calidad, y la Primera Presidencia, el Quórum de los Doce, los Setenta y los líderes buscan fervientemente revelación y comparten revelaciones en la 'Conferencia General', si los miembros no tienen el hábito de aprender, esas inversiones y revelaciones se desperdician.\n\n• Lo que se enseña en la Conferencia General y las Escrituras no se puede dominar leyendo una vez, sino que a menudo requiere que los individuos internalicen profundamente ese aprendizaje y alcancen un nivel donde puedan practicarlo naturalmente. En otras palabras, un 'estado donde pueden recibir revelación personal' confiando en el 'don del Espíritu Santo'. Los ejemplos incluyen bendiciones y ordenanzas del sacerdocio, servicio en la iglesia, familia y comunidad, obra misional y ministración. Estos no se pueden dominar con aprendizaje nocturno, sino que se cultivan a través de hábitos diarios de estudio de las Escrituras y ejercicio de fe. Sin ello, creo que la reunión de Israel no puede funcionar eficazmente.\n\nEstos son solo ejemplos que pensé y no describen correctamente todos los problemas reales, pero incluso estos muestran la importancia de los hábitos de estudio de las Escrituras.\n\nEl Libro de Mormón describe cómo el orgullo de las personas las lleva a dejar de guardar los mandamientos, eventualmente resultando en guerra, discordia y el colapso de la civilización. Los profetas de ese tiempo abordaron estos problemas a través de medios políticos, pero lo que se representó notablemente fue 'el uso de la palabra de Dios'. Alma 31:5 contiene palabras muy poderosas sobre esto:\n\n'Y ahora, como la predicación de la palabra tenía gran tendencia a impulsar a la gente a hacer lo que era justo—sí, había surtido un efecto más potente en la mente del pueblo que la espada o cualquier otra cosa que les había acontecido—por tanto, Alma pensó que era prudente que probaran la virtud de la palabra de Dios.'\n\nCreo que estas palabras también son muy efectivas para abordar problemas sociales internacionales modernos, problemas políticos y problemas de la comunidad local. Esta aplicación fue creada como una extensión del trabajo escolar, pero la hice con la creencia de que puede abordar más efectivamente los problemas que mencioné. A través de esta aplicación, creo que más personas pueden construir 'el hábito del estudio de las Escrituras' en esta sociedad que cambia rápidamente y caótica, recibir 'revelación personal' y hacer esta sociedad mejor.\n\nMuchas gracias por leer este largo texto. Finalmente, que las bendiciones del Señor sean abundantemente derramadas sobre cada uno de ustedes."

            appBackground: "Bối Cảnh Phát Triển Ứng Dụng",
            backgroundStory: "Cảm hứng để tạo ra ứng dụng này đến từ việc nghe bài phát biểu của Clayton Christensen \"Dealing with the Dangers of Success\". Trong đó, ông thảo luận về mối quan hệ chặt chẽ giữa 'các chương trình chính thức' của Giáo hội và 'khải thị cá nhân'.\n\nÔng chỉ ra rằng các chương trình hiện được thực hiện như các chương trình chính thức của Giáo hội—như Trường Chúa Nhật, Hội Tiểu học, Buổi Tối Gia Đình và Seminary—ban đầu không được tạo ra bởi 'chỉ thị từ trụ sở Giáo hội', mà được sinh ra từ 'khải thị cá nhân' của các thành viên địa phương giải quyết các vấn đề họ gặp phải. Bởi vì chúng hiệu quả, sau đó chúng được lãnh đạo trung ương áp dụng và tiêu chuẩn hóa trên toàn thế giới.\n\nTuy nhiên, khi các tổ chức phát triển và mọi thứ trở nên tiêu chuẩn hóa, thật khó để các 'giải pháp mới' xuất hiện từ hiện trường. Anh Christensen nói với các sinh viên BYU rằng ông muốn họ 'không chỉ tuân theo các chương trình tiêu chuẩn hóa, mà tiếp tục nhận cảm hứng và phát minh ra các giải pháp cho các vấn đề mới họ gặp phải'.\n\nDưới đây là các ví dụ về cách khải thị cá nhân đến với các cá nhân:\n\n \n\n1. Trường Chúa Nhật\nThời gian/Địa điểm: 1849, Thung lũng Hồ Muối\nNgay sau khi những người tiên phong đến Hồ Muối, người lớn tuyệt vọng xây dựng nền tảng cuộc sống, và trẻ em bị bỏ mặc. Anh Ballantyne, một người cải đạo Scotland, đau lòng khi thấy trẻ em không được giáo dục và không học phúc âm. Không được ai ra lệnh, ông xin phép Chủ tịch Brigham Young và bắt đầu dạy trẻ em hàng xóm trong nhà của mình (sau đó trong một tòa nhà ông xây trên đất của mình). Điều này rất hiệu quả đến nỗi lan sang các phường khác và cuối cùng trở thành một tổ chức toàn Giáo hội.\n\n2. Hội Tiểu học\nThời gian/Địa điểm: 1878, Farmington, Utah\nChị Aurelia Spencer Rogers lo lắng về những cậu bé hàng xóm chạy quanh đường phố vào đêm khuya gây rắc rối. Chị cảm thấy khủng hoảng rằng 'nếu chúng ta không dạy kỷ luật và đức tin khi chúng còn trẻ, trước khi chúng đến tuổi chức tư tế (khoảng 12 tuổi vào thời điểm đó), chúng ta sẽ không nuôi dưỡng các nhà lãnh đạo Giáo hội tương lai'. Chị tham khảo ý kiến chủ tịch Hội Phụ Nữ vào thời điểm đó (Eliza R. Snow), được sự chấp thuận từ Chủ tịch John Taylor, và tổ chức một cuộc họp thử nghiệm chỉ tập hợp trẻ em ở quê hương của mình (Farmington). 224 trẻ em đã tham dự cuộc họp đầu tiên. Thấy thành công này, nó được đưa vào toàn Giáo hội.\n\n3. Seminary\nThời gian/Địa điểm: 1912, Salt Lake City (đối diện trường Trung học Granite)\nVào thời điểm đó, 'các trường trung học công' bắt đầu lan rộng ở Utah, nhưng giáo dục tôn giáo bị cấm theo luật ở đó. Các chủ tịch cọc địa phương lo ngại rằng 'nếu thanh niên dành cả ngày chỉ học kiến thức thế tục mà không có Đức Chúa Trời, họ có thể mất đức tin'. Họ đề xuất với Hội đồng Giáo dục Giáo hội thuê một ngôi nhà đối diện trường Trung học Granite và tạo ra một lớp học thử nghiệm nơi học sinh có thể đến trong thời gian rảnh để nghiên cứu kinh thánh. Giáo viên đầu tiên là Thomas J. Yates. Nếu 'thử nghiệm cọc Granite' này thất bại, hệ thống Seminary toàn cầu hiện tại có thể không tồn tại.\n\n4. Buổi Tối Gia Đình\nThời gian/Địa điểm: 1909 (bắt đầu ở các cọc), 1915 (được khuyến nghị toàn Giáo hội)\nVào đầu thế kỷ 20, xã hội đang hiện đại hóa và các gia đình bắt đầu dành ít thời gian bên nhau hơn. Năm 1915, Chủ tịch Joseph F. Smith chính thức khuyến nghị 'Buổi Tối Gia Đình' cho toàn Giáo hội, nhưng thực tế, vài năm trước đó vào năm 1909, một chương trình đã được thực hiện thử nghiệm ở cọc Granite với thành công lớn đã trở thành mô hình. Chủ tịch đoàn Đệ nhất thấy thành công ở cọc này và đánh giá rằng 'điều này cần thiết cho tất cả các Thánh đồ' và áp dụng nó.\n\n\n\nSau khi nghe bài phát biểu này, tôi học được rằng 'khải thị cá nhân'—nói cách khác, 'các hành động rất nội tại và được thúc đẩy bởi tình yêu thương, không phải chỉ thị từ trên'—đã tạo ra các chương trình hiện tại của Giáo hội. Tôi cảm thấy rằng nếu có vấn đề ở các khu vực địa phương, thay vì đợi trụ sở Giáo hội giải quyết chúng, điều quan trọng là dựa vào khải thị cá nhân và nhận khải thị cá nhân cho khu vực đó.\n\nỞ đây, tôi cảm thấy một vấn đề chung cho hầu hết các khu vực: thói quen nghiên cứu kinh thánh của các thành viên, thành viên mới và những người tìm hiểu. Đây là điều 'cần được thực hiện rất cá nhân và trong tình yêu gia đình' và cũng là một lĩnh vực mà các nhà lãnh đạo không thể quản lý.\n\nTuy nhiên, tôi tin rằng việc cố ý tránh giải quyết chủ đề này đã dẫn đến một số vấn đề lớn:\n\n• Những người tìm hiểu, thành viên mới và thành viên một phần không thể dễ dàng chia sẻ việc học của họ với người khác, chịu thua sự bận rộn hàng ngày và cám dỗ, không tham gia vào việc nghiên cứu kinh thánh vốn nên là cốt lõi của đức tin, dần dần xa rời tình yêu của Đức Chúa Trời và ngừng tụ họp với Giáo hội.\n\n• Mặc dù trụ sở Giáo hội đầu tư cung cấp 'Thư viện Phúc âm' và các nguồn lực chất lượng, và Chủ tịch đoàn Đệ nhất, Định  Mười hai Sứ đồ, Bảy mươi và các nhà lãnh đạo nhiệt tình tìm kiếm khải thị và chia sẻ khải thị tại 'Đại hội Toàn thể', nếu các thành viên không có thói quen học hỏi, những khoản đầu tư và khải thị đó bị lãng phí.\n\n• Những gì được dạy trong Đại hội Toàn thể và kinh thánh không thể được làm chủ bằng cách đọc một lần, mà thường yêu cầu các cá nhân nội hóa sâu sắc việc học đó và đạt đến mức độ họ có thể thực hành nó một cách tự nhiên. Nói cách khác, một 'trạng thái mà họ có thể nhận khải thị cá nhân' dựa vào 'ân tứ của Đức Thánh Linh'. Ví dụ bao gồm các phước lành và nghi lễ chức tư tế, phục vụ giáo hội, gia đình và cộng đồng, công việc truyền giáo và phục vụ. Những điều này không thể được làm chủ qua việc học qua đêm, mà được nuôi dưỡng thông qua thói quen nghiên cứu kinh thánh hàng ngày và thực hành đức tin. Không có nó, tôi tin rằng việc tập hợp Israel không thể hoạt động hiệu quả.\n\nĐây chỉ là những ví dụ tôi nghĩ ra và không mô tả chính xác tất cả các vấn đề thực tế, nhưng ngay cả những điều này cũng cho thấy tầm quan trọng của thói quen nghiên cứu kinh thánh.\n\nSách Mặc Môn miêu tả cách lòng kiêu căng của mọi người dẫn họ ngừng giữ các điều răn, cuối cùng dẫn đến chiến tranh, bất hòa và sự sụp đổ của nền văn minh. Các tiên tri thời đó đã giải quyết những vấn đề này thông qua các phương tiện chính trị, nhưng điều được miêu tả đáng chú ý là 'việc sử dụng lời của Đức Chúa Trời'. Alma 31:5 chứa những lời rất mạnh mẽ về điều này:\n\n'Và bây giờ, vì việc giảng dạy lời có xu hướng lớn dẫn dắt mọi người làm điều công chính—phải, nó đã có tác động mạnh mẽ hơn đối với tâm trí của mọi người so với gươm, hoặc bất cứ điều gì khác đã xảy ra với họ—do đó Alma nghĩ rằng nên thử đức hạnh của lời Đức Chúa Trời.'\n\nTôi tin rằng những lời này cũng rất hiệu quả trong việc giải quyết các vấn đề xã hội quốc tế hiện đại, vấn đề chính trị và vấn đề cộng đồng địa phương. Ứng dụng này được tạo ra như một phần mở rộng của công việc học hiệu, nhưng tôi làm nó với niềm tin rằng nó có thể giải quyết hiệu quả hơn các vấn đề tôi đã đề cập. Thông qua ứng dụng này, tôi tin rằng nhiều người hơn có thể xây dựng 'thói quen nghiên cứu kinh thánh' trong xã hội thay đổi nhanh chóng và hỗn loạn này, nhận 'khải thị cá nhân' và làm cho xã hội này tốt đẹp hơn.\n\nCảm ơn bạn rất nhiều vì đã đọc văn bản dài này. Cuối cùng, cầu mong những phước lành của Chúa được tràn xuống dồi dào cho mỗi người trong các bạn."

            backgroundStory: "แรงบันดาลใจในการสร้างแอปพลิเคชันนี้มาจากการฟังการบรรยายของ Clayton Christensen เรื่อง \"Dealing with the Dangers of Success\" ซึ่งเขาได้พูดถึงความสัมพันธ์อันใกล้ชิดระหว่าง 'โปรแกรมอย่างเป็นทางการ' ของศาสนจักรกับ 'การเปิดเผยส่วนบุคคล'\n\nเขาชี้ให้เห็นว่าโปรแกรมที่ใช้อยู่ในปัจจุบันเป็นโปรแกรมอย่างเป็นทางการของศาสนจักร—เช่น โรงเรียนวันอาทิตย์ ปฐมวัย ค่ำคืนครอบครัว และสัมมนาจักร—ไม่ได้ถูกสร้างขึ้นจาก 'คำสั่งจากสำนักงานใหญ่ของศาสนจักร' แต่เกิดจาก 'การเปิดเผยส่วนบุคคล' ของสมาชิกท้องถิ่นที่เผชิญปัญหา เพราะมันได้ผล จึงถูกนำไปใช้โดยผู้นำส่วนกลางและทำให้เป็นมาตรฐานทั่วโลก\n\nอย่างไรก็ตาม เมื่อองค์กรเติบโตและทุกอย่างถูกทำให้เป็นมาตรฐาน มันก็ยากที่ 'วิธีแก้ปัญหาใหม่' จะเกิดขึ้นจากภาคสนาม พี่ชาย Christensen บอกนักศึกษา BYU ว่าเขาต้องการให้พวกเขา 'ไม่เพียงแต่ทำตามโปรแกรมมาตรฐาน แต่ยังคงได้รับแรงบันดาลใจและคิดค้นวิธีแก้ปัญหาใหม่ที่พวกเขาเผชิญ'\n\nต่อไปนี้เป็นตัวอย่างว่าการเปิดเผยส่วนบุคคลมาสู่บุคคลอย่างไร:\n\n \n\n1. โรงเรียนวันอาทิตย์\nเวลา/สถานที่: 1849, หุบเขาเกลือ\nหลังจากผู้บุกเบิกมาถึงเลกเกลือทันที ผู้ใหญ่นั้นต้องดิ้นรนในการสร้างพื้นฐานชีวิต และเด็กๆ ถูกทิ้งให้โดดเดี่ยว พี่ชาย Ballantyne ผู้เปลี่ยนใจเลื่อมใสชาวสก็อตแลนด์ เจ็บปวดใจที่เห็นเด็กๆ ไม่ได้รับการศึกษาและไม่ได้เรียนรู้พระกิตติคุณ โดยไม่มีใครสั่ง เขาขออนุญาตจากประธาน Brigham Young และเริ่มสอนเด็กๆ ในละแวกบ้านในบ้านของเขา (ต่อมาในอาคารที่เขาสร้างในที่ดินของเขา) สิ่งนี้มีประสิทธิภาพมากจนแพร่กระจายไปยังวอร์ดอื่นๆ และในที่สุดก็กลายเป็นองค์กรทั่วศาสนจักร\n\n2. ปฐมวัย\nเวลา/สถานที่: 1878, Farmington, Utah\nซิสเตอร์ Aurelia Spencer Rogers กังวลเกี่ยวกับเด็กชายในละแวกบ้านที่วิ่งไปรอบๆ ถนนตอนดึกทำความเสียหาย เธอรู้สึกถึงความวิกฤติว่า 'ถ้าเราไม่สอนวินัยและศรัทธาตอนที่พวกเขายังเด็ก ก่อนที่จะถึงอายุฐานะปุโรหิต (ประมาณ 12 ขวบในยุคนั้น) เราจะไม่เลี้ยงดูผู้นำศาสนจักรในอนาคต' เธอปรึกษากับประธานสมาคมสงเคราะห์ในขณะนั้น (Eliza R. Snow) และได้รับการอนุมัติจากประธาน John Taylor และจัดการประชุมทดลองรวบรวมเด็กๆ เฉพาะในบ้านเกิดของเธอ (Farmington) 224 คนเข้าร่วมการประชุมครั้งแรก เมื่อเห็นความสำเร็จนี้ มันถูกนำไปใช้ทั่วศาสนจักร\n\n3. สัมมนาจักร\nเวลา/สถานที่: 1912, Salt Lake City (ตรงข้ามโรงเรียนมัธยม Granite)\nในเวลานั้น 'โรงเรียนมัธยมของรัฐ' เริ่มแพร่กระจายในยูทาห์ แต่การศึกษาศาสนาถูกห้ามโดยกฎหมายที่นั่น ประธานสเตคท้องถิ่นกังวลว่า 'ถ้าเยาวชนใช้เวลาทั้งวันเรียนรู้เพียงความรู้ทางโลกโดยไม่มีพระเจ้า พวกเขาอาจสูญเสียศรัทธา' พวกเขาเสนอต่อคณะกรรมการการศึกษาของศาสนจักรให้เช่าบ้านตรงข้ามโรงเรียนมัธยม Granite และสร้างชั้นเรียนทดลองที่นักเรียนสามารถมาในเวลาว่างเพื่อศึกษาพระคัมภีร์ ครูคนแรกคือ Thomas J. Yates หาก 'การทดลองสเตค Granite' นี้ล้มเหลว ระบบสัมมนาจักรทั่วโลกในปัจจุบันอาจไม่มีอยู่\n\n4. ค่ำคืนครอบครัว\nเวลา/สถานที่: 1909 (เริ่มในสเตค), 1915 (แนะนำทั่วศาสนจักร)\nในต้นศตวรรษที่ 20 สังคมกำลังทันสมัยและครอบครัวเริ่มใช้เวลาร่วมกันน้อยลง ในปี 1915 ประธาน Joseph F. Smith ได้แนะนำ 'ค่ำคืนครอบครัว' อย่างเป็นทางการทั่วศาสนจักร แต่อันที่จริงหลายปีก่อนหน้านั้นในปี 1909 โปรแกรมที่ดำเนินการทดลองในสเตค Granite ด้วยความสำเร็จอันยิ่งใหญ่กลายเป็นแบบอย่าง สำนักประธานเห็นความสำเร็จในสเตคนี้และตัดสินว่า 'นี่จำเป็นสำหรับวิสุทธิชนทั้งหมด' และนำมาใช้\n\n\n\nหลังจากฟังการบรรยายนี้ ฉันได้เรียนรู้ว่า 'การเปิดเผยส่วนบุคคล'—หรืออีกนัยหนึ่ง 'การกระทำที่เป็นภายในและได้รับแรงจูงใจจากความรัก ไม่ใช่คำสั่งจากข้างบน'—สร้างโปรแกรมปัจจุบันของศาสนจักร ฉันรู้สึกว่าหากมีปัญหาในพื้นที่ท้องถิ่น แทนที่จะรอให้สำนักงานใหญ่ของศาสนจักรแก้ไข สิ่งสำคัญคือต้องพึ่งการเปิดเผยส่วนบุคคลและรับการเปิดเผยส่วนบุคคลสำหรับพื้นที่นั้น\n\nที่นี่ ฉันรู้สึกถึงปัญหาหนึ่งที่พบบ่อยในเกือบทุกพื้นที่: นิสัยการศึกษาพระคัมภีร์ของสมาชิก สมาชิกใหม่ และผู้สืบสวน นี่เป็นสิ่งที่ 'ควรทำอย่างเป็นส่วนตัวและในความรักของครอบครัว' และยังเป็นพื้นที่ที่ผู้นำไม่สามารถจัดการได้\n\nอย่างไรก็ตาม ฉันเชื่อว่าการหลีกเลี่ยงการจัดการกับหัวข้อนี้โดยเจตนาส่งผลให้เกิดปัญหาสำคัญบางอย่าง:\n\n• ผู้สืบสวน สมาชิกใหม่ และสมาชิกบางส่วนไม่สามารถแบ่งปันการเรียนรู้ของพวกเขากับผู้อื่นได้ง่าย ยอมแพ้ต่อความวุ่นวายในชีวิตประจำวันและสิ่งล่อใจ ไม่เข้าร่วมในการศึกษาพระคัมภีร์ซึ่งควรเป็นหัวใจของศรัทธา แยกตัวออกจากความรักของพระเจ้าทีละน้อย และหยุดการชุมนุมกับศาสนจักร\n\n• แม้ว่าสำนักงานใหญ่ของศาสนจักรลงทุนจัดหา 'ห้องสมุดพระกิตติคุณ' และทรัพยากรคุณภาพ และสำนักประธาน สมาคมอัครสาวกสิบสอง เซเว็นตี้ และผู้นำแสวงหาการเปิดเผยอย่างจริงจังและแบ่งปันการเปิดเผยใน 'การประชุมใหญ่' หากสมาชิกไม่มีนิสัยการเรียนรู้ การลงทุนและการเปิดเผยเหล่านั้นก็ถูกสูญเปล่า\n\n• สิ่งที่สอนในการประชุมใหญ่และพระคัมภีร์ไม่สามารถเชี่ยวชาญได้โดยการอ่านครั้งเดียว แต่มักต้องการให้บุคคลดูดซึมการเรียนรู้นั้นลึกซึ้งและบรรลุระดับที่พวกเขาสามารถปฏิบัติได้อย่างเป็นธรรมชาติ กล่าวอีกนัยหนึ่ง 'สถานะที่พวกเขาสามารถรับการเปิดเผยส่วนบุคคล' โดยพึ่งพา 'ของประทานแห่งพระวิญญาณบริสุทธิ์' ตัวอย่างรวมถึงพรและพิธีกรรมฐานะปุโรหิต การให้บริการคริสตจักร ครอบครัว และชุมชน งานมิชชันนารี และการปรนนิบัติ สิ่งเหล่านี้ไม่สามารถเชี่ยวชาญได้จากการเรียนรู้ข้ามคืน แต่ได้รับการพัฒนาผ่านนิสัยการศึกษาพระคัมภีร์รายวันและการใช้ศรัทธา หากไม่มี ฉันเชื่อว่าการรวบรวมอิสราเอลไม่สามารถทำงานได้อย่างมีประสิทธิภาพ\n\nเหล่านี้เป็นเพียงตัวอย่างที่ฉันคิดและไม่ได้อธิบายปัญหาจริงทั้งหมดอย่างถูกต้อง แต่แม้แต่สิ่งเหล่านี้ก็แสดงให้เห็นความสำคัญของนิสัยการศึกษาพระคัมภีร์\n\nพระคัมภีร์มอรมอนบรรยายถึงความภาคภูมิใจของผู้คนที่นำพวกเขาไปสู่การหยุดรักษาพระบัญญัติ ส่งผลให้เกิดสงคราม ความขัดแย้ง และการล่มสลายของอารยธรรมในที่สุด ผู้เผยพระวจนะในยุคนั้นจัดการกับปัญหาเหล่านี้ผ่านวิธีการทางการเมือง แต่สิ่งที่ถูกบรรยายอย่างโดดเด่นคือ 'การใช้พระวจนะของพระเจ้า' แอลมา 31:5 มีถ้อยคำที่ทรงพลังมากเกี่ยวกับเรื่องนี้:\n\n'และบัดนี้ เพราะการเทศนาพระวจนะมีแนวโน้มอย่างมากที่จะนำผู้คนไปสู่การกระทำสิ่งที่ชอบธรรม—แท้จริงแล้ว มันมีผลกระทบที่ทรงพลังกว่าต่อจิตใจของผู้คนมากกว่าดาบ หรืออะไรอื่นที่เคยเกิดขึ้นกับพวกเขา—ดังนั้นแอลมาจึงคิดว่าควรทดลองพระคุณความดีของพระวจนะของพระเจ้า'\n\nฉันเชื่อว่าถ้อยคำเหล่านี้มีประสิทธิภาพมากในการจัดการกับปัญหาสังคมระหว่างประเทศสมัยใหม่ ปัญหาการเมือง และปัญหาชุมชนท้องถิ่น แอปพลิเคชันนี้ถูกสร้างขึ้นเป็นส่วนขยายของงานโรงเรียน แต่ฉันทำมันด้วยความเชื่อว่ามันสามารถจัดการกับปัญหาที่ฉันระบุได้อย่างมีประสิทธิภาพมากขึ้น ผ่านแอปพลิเคชันนี้ ฉันเชื่อว่าคนมากขึ้นสามารถสร้าง 'นิสัยการศึกษาพระคัมภีร์' ในสังคมที่เปลี่ยนแปลงอย่างรวดเร็วและวุ่นวายนี้ รับ 'การเปิดเผยส่วนบุคคล' และทำให้สังคมนี้ดีขึ้น\n\nขอบคุณมากสำหรับการอ่านข้อความยาวนี้ สุดท้าย ขอให้พรของพระเจ้าเทลงมาอย่างอุดมสมบูรณ์เหนือแต่ละคนในพวกคุณ"

            backgroundStory: "이 앱을 만들게 된 영감은 클레이튼 크리스텐슨 형제의 \"Dealing with the Dangers of Success\" 강연을 들은 것에서 비롯되었습니다. 그는 교회의 '공식 프로그램'과 '개인적 계시' 사이의 밀접한 관계에 대해 이야기했습니다.\n\n그는 현재 교회 공식 프로그램으로 시행되는 프로그램들—주일학교, 초등회, 가정의 밤, 세미나리—이 원래 '교회 본부의 지시'로 만들어진 것이 아니라, 현장의 회원들이 직면한 문제를 해결하기 위한 '개인적 계시'에서 탄생했다고 지적했습니다. 그것들이 효과적이었기 때문에 나중에 중앙 지도부에 의해 채택되고 전 세계적으로 표준화되었습니다.\n\n그러나 조직이 성장하고 모든 것이 표준화되면서, 현장에서 '새로운 해결책'이 나오기 어려워집니다. 크리스텐슨 형제는 BYU 학생들에게 '표준화된 프로그램을 따르기만 하는 것이 아니라, 그들이 직면한 새로운 문제에 대한 영감을 받고 해결책을 계속 발명해 나가기를' 바란다고 말했습니다.\n\n다음은 개인적 계시가 개인에게 어떻게 임했는지에 대한 예입니다:\n\n \n\n1. 주일학교\n시기/장소: 1849년, 솔트레이크 계곡\n개척자들이 솔트레이크에 도착한 직후, 어른들은 생활 기반을 만드는 데 필사적이었고 아이들은 방치되었습니다. 스코틀랜드 개종자인 발렌타인 형제는 아이들이 교육을 받지 못하고 복음도 배우지 못하는 것을 보고 마음이 아팠습니다. 그는 누구의 명령도 없이 브리검 영 회장에게 허락을 구하고 자신의 집(나중에 자신의 땅에 지은 건물)에서 이웃 아이들을 가르치기 시작했습니다. 이것이 너무 효과적이어서 다른 와드로 퍼져나갔고 결국 교회 전체 조직이 되었습니다.\n\n2. 초등회\n시기/장소: 1878년, 유타주 파밍턴\n오렐리아 스펜서 로저스 자매는 이웃 소년들이 밤늦게 거리를 돌아다니며 장난을 치는 것을 걱정했습니다. 그녀는 '신권을 받을 나이(당시 약 12세)가 되기 전에 어릴 때부터 규율과 신앙을 가르치지 않으면 미래의 교회 지도자를 기를 수 없을 것이다'라는 위기감을 느꼈습니다. 그녀는 당시 상호부조회 회장(엘리자 R. 스노우)과 상의하고 존 테일러 회장의 승인을 받아 자신의 고향(파밍턴)에서만 시범적으로 아이들을 모으는 모임을 열었습니다. 첫 모임에는 224명의 어린이가 참석했습니다. 이 성공을 보고 교회 전체에 도입되었습니다.\n\n3. 세미나리\n시기/장소: 1912년, 솔트레이크시티(그래니트 고등학교 맞은편)\n당시 유타에서 '공립 고등학교'가 확산되기 시작했지만 법적으로 종교 교육이 금지되어 있었습니다. 지역 스테이크 회장은 '청소년들이 하루 종일 하나님 없는 세속적 지식만 배우면 신앙을 잃을 수 있다'고 우려했습니다. 그들은 교회 교육 위원회에 그래니트 고등학교 맞은편 집을 임대하고 학생들이 여가 시간에 와서 경전을 공부할 수 있는 수업을 실험적으로 만들자고 제안했습니다. 첫 교사는 토마스 J. 예이츠였습니다. 만약 이 '그래니트 스테이크 실험'이 실패했다면, 현재의 전 세계 세미나리 시스템은 존재하지 않았을 것입니다.\n\n4. 가정의 밤\n시기/장소: 1909년(스테이크에서 시작), 1915년(교회 전체 권장)\n20세기 초, 사회가 현대화되면서 가족이 함께 보내는 시간이 줄어들기 시작했습니다. 1915년에 조셉 F. 스미스 회장이 '가정의 밤'을 교회 전체에 공식적으로 권장했지만, 사실 몇 년 전인 1909년에 그래니트 스테이크에서 이미 실험적으로 시행되어 큰 성공을 거둔 프로그램이 모델이 되었습니다. 제일회장단은 이 스테이크의 성공을 보고 '이것은 모든 성도에게 필요하다'고 판단하고 채택했습니다.\n\n\n\n이 강연을 듣고 저는 '개인적 계시'—다시 말해 '위로부터의 지시가 아닌, 매우 내적이고 사랑으로 동기 부여된 행동'—이 현재 교회 프로그램을 만들었다는 것을 배웠습니다. 저는 지역에 문제가 있다면 교회 본부가 해결해 주기를 기다리기보다는 개인적 계시에 의지하고 그 지역을 위한 개인적 계시를 받는 것이 중요하다고 느꼈습니다.\n\n여기서 저는 거의 모든 지역에 공통된 한 가지 문제를 느꼈습니다. 그것은 회원, 새 회원, 구도자의 경전 공부 습관입니다. 이것은 '매우 개인적이고 가족의 사랑 안에서 이루어져야 하는 것'이며 지도자가 관리할 수 없는 영역이기도 합니다.\n\n그러나 이 주제를 의도적으로 다루지 않은 결과, 몇 가지 큰 문제가 발생했다고 저는 생각합니다:\n\n• 구도자, 새 회원, 부분 회원은 자신의 배움을 다른 사람과 쉽게 나눌 수 없고, 일상의 바쁨과 유혹에 지며, 신앙의 핵심이 되어야 할 경전 공부에 참여하지 않고, 점점 하나님의 사랑에서 멀어지며, 교회와 함께 모이는 것을 멈춥니다.\n\n• 교회 본부가 '복음 도서관'과 양질의 자원을 제공하기 위해 투자하고, 제일회장단, 십이사도 정원회, 칠십인, 지도자들이 열심히 계시를 구하고 '총대회'에서 계시를 나누어도, 회원들이 배우는 습관이 없다면 그 투자와 계시는 낭비됩니다.\n\n• 총대회와 경전에서 가르치는 것은 한 번 읽는 것으로 터득할 수 있는 것이 아니라, 개인이 그 배움을 내면 깊이 내재화하고 자연스럽게 실천할 수 있는 수준에 도달해야 하는 경우가 자주 있습니다. 즉 '성신의 은사'에 의지하여 '개인적 계시를 받을 수 있는 상태'입니다. 예를 들어 신권 축복과 의식, 교회, 가족, 지역 사회에서의 봉사, 선교 사업, 미니스터링이 있습니다. 이것들은 하룻밤의 학습으로 터득할 수 있는 것이 아니라 매일의 경전 공부 습관과 신앙의 행사를 통해 배양되는 것입니다. 그것 없이는 이스라엘의 집합이 효과적으로 기능할 수 없다고 저는 생각합니다.\n\n이것들은 제가 생각한 예일 뿐이고 실제 모든 문제를 정확하게 묘사한 것은 아니지만, 이것만으로도 경전 공부 습관의 중요성을 알 수 있습니다.\n\n몰몬경은 백성의 교만으로 계명을 지키지 않게 되고, 결국 전쟁, 불화가 발생하고 문명이 몰락하는 모습을 그립니다. 당시의 선지자들은 물론 정치적 방법으로 이러한 문제를 다루었지만, 특별히 그려진 것은 '하나님의 말씀의 사용'입니다. 앨마서 31:5에는 이에 대한 매우 강력한 말씀이 기록되어 있습니다:\n\n'이제 말씀을 가르치는 것이 백성으로 하여금 옳은 일을 행하게 하는 데 큰 경향이 있었나니, 진실로 그것은 칼이나 그 밖에 그들에게 일어난 어떤 것보다도 백성의 마음에 더욱 강력한 영향을 미쳤으므로, 앨마는 이번에도 하나님의 말씀의 덕을 시도하는 것이 바람직하다고 생각하였느니라.'\n\n이 말씀은 현대의 국제적 사회 문제, 정치 문제, 지역 사회 문제를 다루는 데에도 매우 효과적이라고 저는 믿습니다. 이 앱은 학교 과제의 연장선으로 만들어졌지만, 제가 언급한 문제들을 보다 효과적으로 다룰 수 있다는 믿음으로 만들었습니다. 이 앱을 통해 더 많은 사람들이 급변하고 혼란스러운 이 사회에서 '경전 공부 습관'을 구축하고, '개인적 계시'를 받아 이 사회를 더 나은 곳으로 만들 수 있다고 믿습니다.\n\n긴 글을 읽어주셔서 정말 감사합니다. 마지막으로, 여러분 한 분 한 분에게 주님의 축복이 풍성히 내리기를 바랍니다."

            appBackground: "Kasaysayan ng Pagbuo ng App",
            backgroundStory: "Ang inspirasyon sa paglikha ng app na ito ay nagmula sa pakikinig sa talumpati ni Clayton Christensen na \"Dealing with the Dangers of Success\". Dito, tinalakay niya ang malapit na ugnayan sa pagitan ng 'opisyal na mga programa' ng Simbahan at 'personal na paghahayag'.\n\nItinuro niya na ang mga programang kasalukuyang ipinapatupad bilang opisyal na mga programa ng Simbahan—tulad ng Paaralang Linggo, Primary, Gabi ng Pamilya, at Seminary—ay hindi orihinal na nilikha mula sa 'mga tagubilin mula sa punong tanggapan ng Simbahan', kundi ipinanganak mula sa 'personal na paghahayag' ng mga lokal na miyembro na humaharap sa mga problema. Dahil sila ay epektibo, kalaunan ay pinagtibay ng sentral na pamumuno at naging pamantayan sa buong mundo.\n\nGayunpaman, habang lumalaki ang mga organisasyon at ang lahat ay nagiging standard, nagiging mahirap para sa 'mga bagong solusyon' na lumabas mula sa field. Sinabi ni Brother Christensen sa mga estudyante ng BYU na nais niyang 'hindi lamang sumunod sa mga standardized na programa, kundi patuloy na makatanggap ng inspirasyon at mag-imbento ng mga solusyon sa mga bagong problema na kanilang kinakaharap'.\n\nNarito ang mga halimbawa kung paano dumating ang personal na paghahayag sa mga indibidwal:\n\n \n\n1. Paaralang Linggo\nPanahon/Lugar: 1849, Lambak ng Salt Lake\nKaagad pagkatapos ng pagdating ng mga pioneer sa Salt Lake, ang mga matatanda ay desperado na bumuo ng pundasyon ng buhay, at ang mga bata ay napabayaan. Si Brother Ballantyne, isang Scottish convert, ay nasaktan nang makita ang mga batang hindi nakakatanggap ng edukasyon at hindi natututo ng ebanghelyo. Walang nag-utos sa kanya, humingi siya ng pahintulot kay President Brigham Young at nagsimulang magturo ng mga batang kapitbahay sa kanyang bahay (kalaunan sa isang gusali na itinayo niya sa kanyang lupa). Ito ay napakabisa kaya kumalat sa ibang mga ward at sa huli ay naging organisasyong pangbuong simbahan.\n\n2. Primary\nPanahon/Lugar: 1878, Farmington, Utah\nSi Sister Aurelia Spencer Rogers ay nag-alala tungkol sa mga batang lalaki sa kapitbahayan na tumatakbo sa mga kalye nang gabi-gabi at gumagawa ng kaguluhan. Naramdaman niya ang panganib na 'kung hindi natin tuturuan ng disiplina at pananampalataya habang bata pa sila, bago nila maabot ang edad ng priesthood (humigit-kumulang 12 noon), hindi natin papalaguin ang mga pinuno ng simbahan sa hinaharap'. Kumonsulta siya sa presidente ng Relief Society noon (Eliza R. Snow), nakakuha ng pahintulot mula kay President John Taylor, at nagsagawa ng isang experimental na pagpupulong na nagtipon ng mga bata lamang sa kanyang sariling bayan (Farmington). 224 na mga bata ang dumalo sa unang pagpupulong. Nang makita ang tagumpay na ito, ipinakilala ito sa buong simbahan.\n\n3. Seminary\nPanahon/Lugar: 1912, Salt Lake City (tapat ng Granite High School)\nNoong panahon iyon, nagsimulang kumalat ang 'mga pampublikong mataas na paaralan' sa Utah, ngunit ang edukasyong pangre ligyon ay ipinagbawal ng batas doon. Ang mga lokal na stake president ay nag-alala na 'kung ang mga kabataan ay gugugol ng buong araw na nag-aaral lamang ng secular na kaalaman nang walang Diyos, maaari nilang mawala ang kanilang pananampalataya'. Iminungkahi nila sa Church Board of Education na umupa ng bahay sa tapat ng Granite High School at gumawa ng experimental na klase kung saan ang mga estudyante ay maaaring pumunta sa libre nilang oras upang mag-aral ng mga kasulatan. Ang unang guro ay si Thomas J. Yates. Kung nabigo ang 'eksperimento sa Granite Stake', ang kasalukuyang pandaigdigang Seminary system ay maaaring hindi umiiral.\n\n4. Gabi ng Pamilya\nPanahon/Lugar: 1909 (nagsimula sa mga stake), 1915 (inirekomenda sa buong simbahan)\nSa unang bahagi ng ika-20 siglo, ang lipunan ay nag-modernize at nagsimulang gumugol ang mga pamilya ng mas kaunting oras nang magkasama. Noong 1915, ang Pangulo Joseph F. Smith ay opisyal na inirekomenda ang 'Gabi ng Pamilya' sa buong simbahan, ngunit sa katotohanan, ilang taon bago iyon noong 1909, isang programa na naisagawa na experimentally sa Granite Stake na may malaking tagumpay ang naging modelo. Nakita ng First Presidency ang tagumpay sa stake na ito at hinusgahan na 'ito ay kailangan para sa lahat ng mga Santo' at pinagtibay ito.\n\n\n\nPagkarinig sa talumpating ito, natutunan ko na ang 'personal na paghahayag'—sa madaling salita, 'mga aksyong napaka-intrinsic at na-motivate ng pag-ibig, hindi mga tagubilin mula sa itaas'—ang lumikha ng mga kasalukuyang programa ng Simbahan. Naramdaman ko na kung may mga problema sa mga lokal na lugar, sa halip na maghintay na solusyunan ng punong tanggapan ng Simbahan, mahalagang umasa sa personal na paghahayag at tumanggap ng personal na paghahayag para sa nasabing lugar.\n\nDito, naramdaman ko ang isang problema na karaniwan sa halos lahat ng mga lugar: ang mga gawi sa pag-aaral ng kasulatan ng mga miyembro, bagong miyembro, at mga imbestigador. Ito ay isang bagay na 'dapat gawin nang napaka-personal at sa loob ng pag-ibig ng pamilya' at isang lugar din na hindi kayang pamahalaan ng mga pinuno.\n\nGayunpaman, naniniwala ako na ang sadyang pag-iwas sa pakikitungo sa paksang ito ay nagresulta sa ilang mahahalagang problema:\n\n• Ang mga imbestigador, bagong miyembro, at bahagyang miyembro ay hindi madaling makapagbahagi ng kanilang pag-aaral sa iba, sumuko sa araw-araw na kaguluhan at tukso, hindi makibahagi sa pag-aaral ng kasulatan na dapat ang core ng pananampalataya, unti-unting lumayo sa pag-ibig ng Diyos, at tumitigil na makipagtipon sa Simbahan.\n\n• Kahit na ang punong tanggapan ng Simbahan ay nag-invest sa pagbibigay ng 'Gospel Library' at mga de-kalidad na resources, at ang First Presidency, Quorum of the Twelve, Seventy, at mga pinuno ay taos-pusong naghahanap ng paghahayag at nagbabahagi ng mga paghahayag sa 'General Conference', kung ang mga miyembro ay walang gawi ng pag-aaral, ang mga pamumuhunan at paghahayag na iyon ay nasasayang.\n\n• Ang mga itinuro sa General Conference at mga kasulatan ay hindi makukuha sa pamamagitan ng pagbabasa nang isang beses, kundi kadalasang nangangailangan na ang mga indibidwal ay malalim na mag-internalize ng pag-aaral na iyon at maabot ang antas kung saan sila ay maaaring natural na magsanay nito. Sa madaling salita, isang 'kalagayan kung saan maari silang tumanggap ng personal na paghahayag' na umaasa sa 'kaloob ng Espiritu Santo'. Ang mga halimbawa ay kinabibilangan ng mga pagpapala at ordinansa ng priesthood, serbisyo sa simbahan, pamilya, at komunidad, misyonaryo work, at ministering. Ang mga ito ay hindi makukuha mula sa pag-aaral ng overnight, kundi pinaunlad sa pamamagitan ng araw-araw na mga gawi sa pag-aaral ng kasulatan at pagsasanay ng pananampalataya. Nang wala ito, naniniwala ako na ang pagtitipon ng Israel ay hindi maaaring gumana nang epektibo.\n\nIto ay mga halimbawa lamang na naisip ko at hindi ito tumpak na naglalarawan sa lahat ng aktwal na mga problema, ngunit kahit na ang mga ito ay nagpapakita ng kahalagahan ng mga gawi sa pag-aaral ng kasulatan.\n\nInilarawan ng Aklat ni Mormon kung paano humantong ang pagmamataas ng mga tao sa kanilang paghinto sa pagsunod sa mga utos, na sa huli ay nagresulta sa digmaan, hidwaan, at pagbagsak ng sibilisasyon. Ang mga propeta noon ay tumugon sa mga problemang ito sa pamamagitan ng mga pampulitikang paraan, ngunit ang lubhang inilarawan ay ang 'paggamit ng salita ng Diyos'. Ang Alma 31:5 ay naglalaman ng napakalakas na mga salita tungkol dito:\n\n'At ngayon, dahil ang pangangaral ng salita ay may malaking hilig na patnubayan ang mga tao na gawin ang matuwid—oo, ito ay may mas malakas na epekto sa mga isip ng mga tao kaysa sa tabak, o anumang iba pang nangyari sa kanila—samakatuwid ay naisip ni Alma na nararapat na subukan nila ang kabutihan ng salita ng Diyos.'\n\nNaniniwala ako na ang mga salitang ito ay napakabisa rin sa pag-address sa mga modernong pandaigdigang isyung panlipunan, mga isyung pampulitika, at mga problemang lokal na komunidad. Ang app na ito ay ginawa bilang extension ng school work, ngunit ginawa ko ito sa paniniwala na mas epektibo nitong matutugunan ang mga problema na nabanggit ko. Sa pamamagitan ng app na ito, naniniwala ako na mas maraming tao ang makakabuo ng 'gawi ng pag-aaral ng kasulatan' sa mabilis na pagbabago at magulo na lipunang ito, makatanggap ng 'personal na paghahayag', at gawing mas mabuti ang lipunang ito.\n\nMaraming salamat sa inyong pagbabasa ng mahabang tekstong ito. Sa wakas, nawa'y sagana ang mga pagpapala ng Panginoon sa bawat isa sa inyo."

            appBackground: "Historia ya Maendeleo ya Programu",
            backgroundStory: "Msukumo wa kuunda programu hii ulitoka kwa kusikiliza hotuba ya Clayton Christensen \"Dealing with the Dangers of Success\". Ndani yake, alijadili uhusiano wa karibu kati ya 'programu rasmi' za Kanisa na 'ufunuo binafsi'.\n\nAlieleza kuwa programu zinazotekelezwa sasa kama programu rasmi za Kanisa—kama Shule ya Jumapili, Primary, Usiku wa Familia, na Seminary—hazikuundwa awali kutoka kwa 'maelekezo kutoka makao makuu ya Kanisa', lakini zilizaliwa kutoka kwa 'ufunuo binafsi' wa wanachama wa mtaa wanaokabili matatizo. Kwa sababu zilikuwa na ufanisi, baadaye zilipitishwa na uongozi wa kati na kufanywa viwango duniani kote.\n\nHata hivyo, kadiri mashirika yanavyokua na kila kitu kinakuwa kiwango, inakuwa vigumu kwa 'suluhisho mpya' kutokea kutoka uwanjani. Ndugu Christensen aliwaambia wanafunzi wa BYU kwamba alitaka 'sio kufuata tu programu za kiwango, lakini kuendelea kupokea msukumo na kuvumbua suluhisho kwa matatizo mapya wanayokabili'.\n\nHapa kuna mifano ya jinsi ufunuo binafsi ulivyowajia watu binafsi:\n\n \n\n1. Shule ya Jumapili\nWakati/Mahali: 1849, Bonde la Salt Lake\nMara baada ya wahamiaji kufika Salt Lake, wazee walikuwa wamekata tamaa kuunda msingi wa maisha, na watoto waliachwa bila usimamizi. Ndugu Ballantyne, mwongofu wa Kiskoti, alipatwa na uchungu kuona watoto wasiopokea elimu na wasijifunze injili. Bila kuamrishwa na mtu yeyote, alitaka ruhusa kutoka kwa Rais Brigham Young na kuanza kufundisha watoto wa jirani kwenye nyumba yake (baadaye katika jengo aliloj enga kwenye ardhi yake). Hii ilikuwa na ufanisi sana kiasi kwamba ilienea kwa wodi nyingine na hatimaye ikawa shirika la Kanisa lote.\n\n2. Primary\nWakati/Mahali: 1878, Farmington, Utah\nDada Aurelia Spencer Rogers alikuwa na wasiwasi kuhusu wavulana wa jirani wanaokimbia mitaani usiku wa manane wakifanya fujo. Alihisi hatari kwamba 'kama hatuwafundishi nidhamu na imani wakati wakiwa wadogo, kabla ya kufikia umri wa ukuhani (karibu miaka 12 wakati huo), hatutakuliza viongozi wa Kanisa wa siku zijazo'. Alishauriana na rais wa Relief Society wakati huo (Eliza R. Snow), akapata idhini kutoka kwa Rais John Taylor, na kufanya mkutano wa majaribio wa kukusanya watoto tu katika mji wake (Farmington). Watoto 224 walihudhuria mkutano wa kwanza. Kuona mafanikio haya, ilianzishwa katika Kanisa lote.\n\n3. Seminary\nWakati/Mahali: 1912, Salt Lake City (mbele ya Shule ya Upili ya Granite)\nWakati huo, 'shule za upili za umma' zilianza kuenea huko Utah, lakini elimu ya dini ilikatazwa kwa sheria pale. Marais wa stake wa mtaa walikuwa na wasiwasi kwamba 'kama vijana watatumia siku nzima wakijifunza maarifa ya kidunia tu bila Mungu, wanaweza kupoteza imani yao'. Walipendekeza kwa Bodi ya Elimu ya Kanisa kupata nyumba mbele ya Shule ya Upili ya Granite na kuunda darasa la majaribio ambapo wanafunzi wangeweza kuja wakati wa bure kusoma maandiko. Mwalimu wa kwanza alikuwa Thomas J. Yates. Kama 'jaribio la Granite Stake' lingeshindwa, mfumo wa Seminary wa ulimwengu wa sasa unaweza usikuwepo.\n\n4. Usiku wa Familia\nWakati/Mahali: 1909 (ilianza katika stake), 1915 (ilipendekez wa kwa Kanisa lote)\nMwanzoni mwa karne ya 20, jamii ilikuwa ikiendelea kisasa na familia zilianza kutumia muda kidogo pamoja. Mnamo 1915, Rais Joseph F. Smith alipendekeza rasmi 'Usiku wa Familia' kwa Kanisa lote, lakini kwa kweli, miaka michache kabla ya hapo mnamo 1909, programu ambayo tayari ilikuwa ikitekelezwa kwa majaribio katika Granite Stake kwa mafanikio makubwa ikawa mfano. Uongozi wa Kwanza waliona mafanikio katika stake hii na wakaamua kwamba 'hii ni muhimu kwa Watakatifu wote' na wakaipitisha.\n\n\n\nBaada ya kusikiliza hotuba hii, nilijifunza kwamba 'ufunuo binafsi'—kwa maneno mengine, 'matendo ambayo yalikuwa ya ndani sana na yenye motisha ya upendo, sio maelekezo kutoka juu'—yaliunda programu za sasa za Kanisa. Nilihisi kwamba kama kuna matatizo katika maeneo ya mtaa, badala ya kusubiri makao makuu ya Kanisa kuyatatua, ni muhimu kutegemea ufunuo binafsi na kupokea ufunuo binafsi kwa eneo hilo.\n\nHapa, nilihisi tatizo moja la kawaida kwa maeneo mengi: tabia za kusoma maandiko za wanachama, wanachama wapya, na wachunguzi. Hii ni kitu 'ambacho kifanywe kibinafsi sana na ndani ya upendo wa familia' na pia ni eneo ambalo viongozi hawawezi kusimamia.\n\nHata hivyo, ninaamini kwamba kuepuka makusudi kushughulikia mada hii kumesababisha baadhi ya matatizo makubwa:\n\n• Wachunguzi, wanachama wapya, na wanachama sehemu hawawezi kushiriki kwa urahisi mafunzo yao na wengine, washindwe na shughuli za kila siku na majaribu, wasihusike na kusoma maandiko ambayo inapaswa kuwa kiini cha imani, wajitenganishe polepole kutoka upendo wa Mungu, na kuacha kukusanyika na Kanisa.\n\n• Ingawa makao makuu ya Kanisa yanawekeza kutoa 'Maktaba ya Injili' na rasilimali za ubora, na Uongozi wa Kwanza, Baraza la Mitume Kumi na Wawili, Sabini, na viongozi wanatafuta kwa bidii ufunuo na kushiriki ufunuo katika 'Mkutano Mkuu', ikiwa wanachama hawana tabia ya kujifunza, uwekezaji huo na ufunuo unachukuliwa bure.\n\n• Kile kinachofundishwa katika Mkutano Mkuu na maandiko hakiwezi kujulikana kwa kusoma mara moja, lakini mara nyingi kunahitaji watu binafsi kujumuisha kwa kina mafunzo hayo na kufikia kiwango ambacho wanaweza kufanya kwa asili. Kwa maneno mengine, 'hali ambapo wanaweza kupokea ufunuo binafsi' wakitegemea 'zawadi ya Roho Mtakatifu'. Mifano ni pamoja na baraka na ibada za ukuhani, huduma ya kanisa, familia, na jamii, kazi ya uinjilisti, na huduma. Hizi haziwezi kujulikana kutoka kwa kujifunza usiku mmoja, lakini hukuliwa kupitia tabia za kusoma maandiko kila siku na kutumia imani. Bila yake, ninaamini kwamba kukusanyika kwa Israeli hakuwezi kufanya kazi kwa ufanisi.\n\nHizi ni mifano tu niliyofikiri na hazielezi kwa usahihi matatizo yote halisi, lakini hata hizi zinaonyesha umuhimu wa tabia za kusoma maandiko.\n\nKitabu cha Mormoni kinaeleza jinsi kiburi cha watu kilivyowaongoza kuacha kuzingatia amri, hatimaye kusababisha vita, migogoro, na kuanguka kwa ustaarabu. Manabii wa wakati huo walishughulikia matatizo haya kwa njia za kisiasa, lakini kile kilichoelezewa kwa umakini ni 'matumizi ya neno la Mungu'. Alma 31:5 ina maneno yenye nguvu sana kuhusu hili:\n\n'Na sasa, kwa kuwa kuhubiri neno kulikuwa na mwelekeo mkubwa wa kuongoza watu kufanya yaliyo ya haki—ndiyo, kulikuwa na athari kubwa zaidi kwenye akili za watu kuliko upanga, au kitu kingine chochote kilichowatokea—kwa hiyo Alma alidhani ni vyema wajaribu fadhila ya neno la Mungu.'\n\nNinaamini kwamba maneno haya pia yana ufanisi sana katika kushughulikia masuala ya kijamii ya kisasa ya kimataifa, masuala ya kisiasa, na matatizo ya jamii za mtaa. Programu hii iliundwa kama ongezeko la kazi ya shule, lakini niliifanya kwa imani kwamba inaweza kushughulikia kwa ufanisi zaidi matatizo niliyoyataja. Kupitia programu hii, ninaamini watu zaidi wanaweza kujenga 'tabia ya kusoma maandiko' katika jamii hii inayobadilika haraka na ya machafuko, kupokea 'ufunuo binafsi', na kufanya jamii hii kuwa bora.\n\nAsante sana kwa kusoma maandishi haya marefu. Mwishowe, baraka za Bwana zimwagwe kwa wingi juu ya kila mmoja wenu."
